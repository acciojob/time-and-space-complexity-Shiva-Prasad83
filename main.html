	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time.It is important to write efficient algorithms.</p>
	<p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm. It can be expressed as O(n), where n is the size of the input data. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a crucial aspect to consider when analyzing algorithms.</p>
